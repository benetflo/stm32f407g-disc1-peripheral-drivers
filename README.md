# WORK IN PROGRESS

This project contains a set of low-level peripheral drivers and a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for the STM32F407VG microcontroller.

The driver layer was developed as part of a learning project based on a Udemy course. The course provided example drivers following the STM32F4 reference manual and datasheet, and I made personal modifications to adapt them to my own needs.
On top of that, I designed and implemented an abstraction layer entirely by myself, extending the base drivers to make peripheral usage easier and more modular.
